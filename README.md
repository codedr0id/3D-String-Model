# 3D-String-Model
 A program to generate a 3D structure that on rotation represents 2 different strings of same length.
 
  This code is written in Python 3.7.0 and executed as a single Python Script in Blender. It uses a Command Line interface for the user to input the Strings.
  The Model is then rendered and the user can view and rotate the 3D model to view both the Strings in different planes.
